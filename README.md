## 🤡 Who Am I???

Hi, I'm AbyssBite ;; Your friendly neighborhood chaos engineer.

I don't just wear hats ;; I wear tinfoil and paranoia like armor:
- 🛠️ **Sysadmin** – I fix one thing and break three others  
- 📦 **DevOps** – CI/CD = "Commit, Ignore, Cry, Deploy"  
- 🐍 **Python** – My scripts work... eventually  
- 🐧 **Linux** – I dual-boot **Kali** and **Parrot** just to feel something  
- 🐳 **Docker** – Because "it works on my machine" wasn’t portable enough  
- 🔐 **Cybersecurity** – I test security by disabling firewalls, clicking phishing links, and yelling "try harder"

---
## What I Actually Do

- Write scripts that *should* automate things, but mostly log errors
- Deploy containers that run fine until someone actually uses them
- Forget to commit until 3 days of changes vanish
- SSH into servers and stare at them until they magically fix themselves
- Say "just one more config tweak" before nuking the entire system

## 🛠️ Tools I Abuse Daily

| Category     | Tools                                                                 |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Languages** | Python, Bash                                                          |
| **OS**        | Linux (Debian + a sprinkle of tears), Windows (for when self-torture isn’t painful enough) |
| **DevOps**    | Docker, Git, Nginx, Systemd                                           |
| **CyberSec**  | nmap, Wireshark, Metasploit, Burp, Fail2ban (ironically)             |
| **Mistakes**  | `sudo rm -rf /`, `git push --force`, `docker system prune -a`        |

## 🧪 Currently Experimenting With

- Writing Python scripts that *almost* don't break the OS  
- Abusing Docker to run VMs inside containers inside VMs  
- Turning Raspberry Pi into a DNS sinkhole and semi-sentient AI bot  
- Securing my server by unplugging it  
- Logging everything, checking none of it

## 🧠 Philosophy

> “Everything’s a file. Until it’s not. Then it’s a kernel panic.”  
> – Me, after the 47th reboot
>
>“Why secure it when you can just deny all traffic?”  
> – Firewall config from hell
>
> “Automation is just doing the wrong thing faster.”

## 🧃 Contact

**Wanna collab?**  
_(Wasn't expecting that tbh)_  
Great. Fork something, open a PR, and prepare for chaos.  

If you're emailing me, **include logs, screenshots, and bribes**.  
Bonus points if your subject line includes `URGENT: EVERYTHING'S ON FIRE`.
